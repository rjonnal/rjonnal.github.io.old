I am a neuroscientist and engineer who studies the human retina by developing new ways to image it and make inferences about its morphology and physiology. My lab primarily utilizes an interferometric imaging modality called *optical coherence tomography* (OCT), with which the living human retina can be visualized in three dimensions. We also use *adaptive optics* (AO), a technique for measuring and correcting blur caused by the eye's imperfect optics. Together, AO and OCT provide a three-dimensional picture of the retina with enough resolution to see each of its millions of cells.
